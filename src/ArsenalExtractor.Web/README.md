# Accessible Astro Starter

This starter project is build upon the (awesome) [Astro Static Site Builder](https://astro.build/). To help you build your project *faster*, this theme includes some dedicated accessible components (such as a keyboard accessible and responsive navigation) and several components coming from the [Accessible Astro Components](https://github.com/markteekman/accessible-astro-components) npm package. This theme also includes example pages, a blog with dynamic routes, a custom 404 page and many **Design System** utility classes, patterns and primatives (such as grids, buttons, lists, spacings, sizes and more).

## Utilities

üëâüèª &nbsp;  _Note: Examples are included in the **index.astro** file_

This starter contains some extra **Design System** like utility classes to aid in the global layout of your project. All of this can be found in the `src/assets/scss/base` directory, and compiles in the `src/assets/globals.scss` file. Using these primitives is totally optional, use or remove at your own preference :) What it contains:

- Reset file to reset browser defaults and ensure everything looks good
- Some basic font settings, such as responsive heading sizes
- Color shades for your color pallet, rendered to the `:root` of your website as custom properties
- Simple auto-grid setting using `display: grid` and a `data-attribute`
- A bit more advanced grid settings using `display` grid to easily setup a 12-column layout
- Utilities set in `_utility.scss` for things such as spacing, sizes, colors, and box-shadows

### 12 Column Grid

12 Column Grid enables you to build custom column based layouts. Using `display: grid;` you can define the amount of columns that elements should take up in your `.grid`, and for which breakpoint they should do so. You can also use offset on a grid to create an extra column of offset. The grid offers different utilities for the individual grid items such `equal-height`, `x-start`, `x-center`, `x-end`, `y-start`, `y-center` and `y-end`. Grid comes with default gutters, to disable them you can use the utility class `no-gutters`.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="small-12 medium-3">
      <h3>Sidebar</h3>
      <!-- ... -->
    </div>
    <div class="small-12 medium-8 offset-medium-4">
      <h3>Main</h3>
      <!-- ... -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Alignment

Alignment classes can be used to align elements in your HTML. There's `align-center`, `align-horizontal` and `align-vertical`.

```html
<div class="align-center w-screen h-screen">
  <h1>Center me on the screen!</h1>
</div>
```

### Animations

There are a couple of basic animations which you can throw on your HTML elements like `blink`, `fade-in`, `pop-up` and `spin`. You can also use some animation delays to create different effects.

```html
<div data-animation="fade-in">
  <p>I've got a fancy fade-in animation that starts right away.</p>
</div>
<div data-animation="fade-in" data-animation-delay="0.25s">
  <p>I've got a fancy fade-in animation after 0.25s.</p>
</div>
<div data-animation="fade-in" data-animation-delay="0.5s">>
  <p>I've got a fancy fade-in animation after 0.5s.</p>
</div>
```

### Auto Grid

Simply apply the `data-auto-grid` attribute on your parent `div` with a number from 2-6 (if you need more columns just tweak the for loop in `_auto-grid.scss`). The grid automatically creates new rows (this is how `display: grid` works by default).

```html
<div class="container" data-auto-grid="3">
  <p>First column</p>
  <p>Second column</p>
  <p>Third column</p>
</div>
```

You can also center the contents of the cell using the `data-grid-center` attribute. Use it together with `data-auto-grid`.

```html
<div class="container" data-auto-grid="3" data-grid-center>
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

### Borders

With two border radius utility classes (`radius-small` and `radius-large`) you can change the border radius of your HTML elements on the fly.

```html
<div class="bg-neutral-900 space-32 radius-large">
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>
</div>
```

### Buttons

A Button primitive to easily apply button styles to your `<button>` and `<a>` tags. Simply apply the class `button` to your element. There are different variations in colors (`color-secondary`, `color-info`, `color-success`, `color-warning`, `color-error`) which is primary by default, sizing (`size-tiny`, `size-large`, `size-huge`) which is medium by default and behavior (`behavior-full`) which stretches the button to 100% width.

```html
<a href="/" class="button color-success size-huge behavior-full">
  Click me to go to space!
</a>
```

### Colors

You can setup your own color schemes in the `_colors.scss` file. You'll find a SCSS map, which gets printed inside `_root.scss` as custom properties. There are also several color utilities such as `text-primary-#` and `bg-neutral-#` based on all colors you've defined. `text-primary-#` should be used on a parent element to give the child's the respective color.

```scss
$colors: (
  primary: (
    100: hsl(262, 90%, 95%),
    200: hsl(262, 100%, 88%),
    300: hsl(262, 100%, 78%),
    400: hsl(268, 82%, 60%),
    500: hsl(273, 79%, 48%),
  ),
  // ...
);
```

```html
<div class="text-neutral-100 bg-neutral-900 space-32">
  <p>Dark background with white text on it!</p>
</div>
```

### Elevations

Use elevations on your HTML elements to add a box shadow of different intensities. Use either `elevation-100`, `elevation-200`, `elevation-300`, `elevation-400` or `elevation-500`.

```html
<div class="space-32 radius-large elevation-400">
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>
</div>
```

### Height / Width

You can set the height and width of your elements to either 100 view port units or percentages using `h-screen`, `h-full`, `w-screen` and `w-full` respectfully.

```html
<div class="h-screen w-screen align-center">
  <p>I'm centered in the middle of the screen!</p>
</div>
```

### Margins, Paddings and Spaces

To prevent spacing each element in your website individually and to prevent inconsistencies, you can use the `.margin-#` and `.padding-#` utility classes. A good practice is to set in on your `<section>` elements, for starters. To space out content you can use a special `.space-content` class on your parent div (for example an element of your `.grid`). By default, margin/padding top and bottom are set with these utilities. You can also set it explicitly using either `.top` of `.bottom` class tokens. Find or tweak all spacing options in `_space.scss`. `space-#` tokens however add padding all around an element, which is great of you need to make card like blocks on the fly by combining `space` with the other utilities.

```html
<section class="padding-32">
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="margin-16 bottom">Grid example</h2>
  </div>
</section>
```

```html
<div class="box space-32 bg-primary-200 radius-small elevation-100">
  <div class="space-content">
    <h3>I look like a card!</h3>
    <p>And space-content adds space between us for readability.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Sizes

If you need an exception on your font-size for a specific reason you can use size utility classes to accomplish that. Using it is easy. Find or tweak all spacing options in `_size.scss`.

```html
<div class="container">
  <p class="size-20">I'm a bigger font size!</p>
</div>
```
